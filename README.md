# saseR

saseR is a highly performant and fast algorithm to perform aberrant expression and splicing analyses. By using adapted offsets in the negative binomial framework, we have shown that aberrant and differential splicing can be modelled. Next, by using an adapted mean-variance structure, we get unbiased estimators that can be used when many latent confounders are included, which is often the case for rare Mendelian studies. With this combination of adapted offsets and fast parameter estimation, we have shown that we are much faster compared to the state-of-the-art aberrant expression and splicing algorithms, while outperforming the latter to detect aberrant splicing events.
